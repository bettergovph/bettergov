## Getting Started with Meilisearch

Think of Meilisearch as the brain behind BetterGov's search feature. It helps users quickly find government services, offices, and information they need. Here's how to get it running on your machine.

### What You'll Need

Before we begin, make sure you have these ready:

1. **Node.js** version 22 or newer (check with `node --version`)
2. **A text editor** to update configuration files
3. **Terminal access** to run commands
4. **About 10 minutes** for the initial setup

### Setting Everything Up

#### Step 1: Install Meilisearch

First, let's get Meilisearch installed. Pick the method that works best for your system:

**macOS:**

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install meilisearch
```

Or download directly:

```bash
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
```

**Windows:**

Using PowerShell (run as Administrator):

```powershell
# Download the latest Windows executable
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases/latest/download/meilisearch-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "meilisearch.exe"

# Run Meilisearch
.\meilisearch.exe --master-key="your_master_key_here"
```

Or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```bash
# In WSL terminal
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
```

**Linux:**

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Download and install
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh

# Or using apt (after adding repository)
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/meilisearch/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install meilisearch
```

Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:

```bash
# Download binary
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh

# Or using the binary directly
curl -L -o meilisearch https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases/latest/download/meilisearch-linux-amd64
chmod +x meilisearch
```

**Using Docker (All Platforms):**

```bash
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest
docker run -p 7700:7700 -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY="your_master_key_here" getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

For more installation options, check the [official installation guide](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/self_hosted/getting_started_with_self_hosted_meilisearch).

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Configuration

Now, let's tell the app how to connect to Meilisearch. Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy `.env.example` as a starting point):

```env
# Where Meilisearch lives
VITE_MEILISEARCH_HOST=http://localhost
VITE_MEILISEARCH_PORT=7700

# Your master key (keep this secret!)
MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key_here

# Search key for the frontend (we'll generate this in Step 4)
VITE_MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_api_key_here
```

**Quick tip:** The master key is like your admin password - it can do everything. The search key is read-only, perfect for the frontend where users will be searching

#### Step 3: Fire Up Meilisearch

Time to start Meilisearch! Use the same master key you put in your `.env` file:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# If installed locally
meilisearch --master-key="your_master_key_here"

# Or if you downloaded the binary directly
./meilisearch --master-key="your_master_key_here"
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# In PowerShell
.\meilisearch.exe --master-key="your_master_key_here"

# Or in Command Prompt
meilisearch.exe --master-key="your_master_key_here"
```

**Using Docker (All Platforms):**

```bash
docker run -p 7700:7700 -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY="your_master_key_here" getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

You'll know it's working when you see messages like:

- "Meilisearch is running"
- "Server listening on 'http://127.0.0.1:7700'"

Keep this terminal window open while you're developing!

#### Step 4: Generate Your Search Key

Almost there! Now we need to create a special key that the website will use for searching. In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
npm run index:create-key
```

This will show you a new API key. Copy it and update your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_API_KEY=<paste_your_generated_key_here>
```

This key can only search - it can't modify data, making it safe to use in the browser

### Loading Your Data

Now for the fun part - let's populate Meilisearch with all the government data!

#### The Main Index

This is the command you'll use most often. It loads all the government services, directories, and websites:

```bash
# Add or update data in the search index
npm run index:meilisearch

# Starting fresh? Use this to rebuild everything from scratch
npm run index:meilisearch:reset
```

This command processes:

- **Government services** - All the services citizens can access
- **Directory listings** - Contact information for government offices
- **Official websites** - Links to government web resources

#### Specialized Data Sets

**Flood Control Projects:**

Keep flood control project data searchable:

```bash
# Update flood control data from ArcGIS
npm run index:flood-control:arcgis

# Rebuild the flood control index completely
npm run index:flood-control:arcgis:reset
```

**Contractor Information:**

Make contractor profiles searchable (run these in order):

```bash
# Step 1: Download the latest contractor data
npm run fetch:contractor-profiles

# Step 2: Clean up and remove duplicates
npm run process:unique-contractors

# Step 3: Add to the search index
npm run index:contractor-profiles
```

## Working with Data

These scripts help process and organize government data. Each one has a specific job:

**URL and Navigation:**

- `add-directory-slugs.js` - Creates clean URLs for directory pages (like turning "Department of Health" into "department-of-health")
- `add-lgu-slugs.js` - Does the same for Local Government Unit pages

**Data Organization:**

- `extract-regions.js` - Organizes data by Philippine regions
- `extract-websites.js` - Collects official government website URLs
- `flatten-contacts.js` - Makes contact info easier to search through
- `split-lgu.cjs` - Breaks up large LGU files so pages load faster
- `split-services.js` - Organizes services by category
- `fetch-hrep.js` - Gets the latest House of Representatives member data

## Building the Site

These scripts create files that help search engines and AI assistants understand our site:

**For Search Engines (Google, Bing, etc.):**

```bash
npm run generate:sitemap
```

Creates a sitemap.xml that tells search engines about all our pages.

**For AI Assistants:**

```bash
npm run generate:llms-txt
```

Generates llms.txt to help AI tools understand our content structure.

**Generate Both at Once:**

```bash
npm run generate:metadata
```

This is automatically run during the build process.

## Managing Contractors

These scripts work together to keep contractor information up-to-date:

1. **`fetch_contractor_profiles.cjs`** - Downloads the latest contractor data
2. **`process_contractors.cjs`** - Cleans up the data and removes duplicates
3. **`index_contractors.cjs`** - Makes the data searchable

Run them in that order when updating contractor information.

## Flood Control Projects

We have two ways to manage flood control project data:

**From Local Files:**

- `index_flood_control.cjs` - Uses JSON files stored in the project

**From ArcGIS (Recommended):**

- `index_flood_control_arcgis.js` - Pulls the latest data directly from government GIS systems

### Working with Cloudflare D1 Database

If you're deploying to Cloudflare, you can also load flood control data into their D1 database:

```bash
# Go to the flood control data folder
cd src/data/flood_control

# Load the data
node load_flood_control.js
```

**Before running this, make sure you have:**

- Wrangler CLI set up (Cloudflare's command-line tool)
- A D1 database configured in your project
- The `flood_control.json` data file ready

## When Things Go Wrong

Don't worry, we've all been there! Here are fixes for common issues:

### "Can't connect to Meilisearch"

This usually means Meilisearch isn't running. Try these:

- Make sure you started Meilisearch (Step 3 above)
- Check your `.env` file has the right host and port
- Double-check your master key matches what you're using to start Meilisearch

### "API key not found" or "Invalid API key"

You probably need to generate a search key:

1. Run `npm run index:create-key`
2. Copy the key it gives you
3. Update your `.env` file with the new key

### "My search isn't finding anything"

A few things to check:

- Did the indexing finish without errors?
- Try running `npm run index:meilisearch:reset` to rebuild from scratch
- Check the terminal for any error messages

### "Out of memory" errors

If you're working with lots of data, Node might need more memory:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run index:meilisearch
```

This gives Node 4GB of memory to work with.
