## Contribution workflow

Official Github Docs on [Forking a repository][forking]

### Initial Setup

**Fork the Repository on GitHub**

- Go to the main project repository (`github.com/bettergovph/bettergov`).
- Click the **"Fork"** button to create a copy under your Github account.

**Clone the Forked Repository to Local Machine**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bettergov.git
cd bettergov
```

**Add the Original Repository as an Upstream**

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bettergovph/bettergov.git
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Branch creation

**Update local main before creating a new branch**

```sh
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

**Create a New Feature Branch**

Create a branch using a prefix-based convention (feature/, fix/, docs/, etc.) to maintain clarity.

**Format**

```text
<prefix>/<short-description>
```

**Example**

```sh
feature/add-login-form
fix/navbar-responsive-issue
docs/add-contributing-and-code-of-conduct
```

> Tip: Keep branch names short, descriptive, and kebab-case.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Development Loop

**Make Changes**  
Make sure your code passes linting and tests before committing.

```sh
git add .
git commit -a
```

**⚠️ Important:** Commit your changes following the Conventional Commits standard.

**Commit messages**

We follow [Conventional Commits][commits] for all commit messages.
This helps keep our history clean and readable.

**Format**

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>
```

**Common Types Used**

- feat: → A new feature
- fix: → A bug fix
- docs: → Documentation only changes
- style: → Code style or formatting changes (no logic)
- refactor: → Code refactoring (no feature or fix)
- test: → Adding or updating tests
- chore: → Maintenance tasks (build process, dependencies, etc.)

**Example**

```sh
feat(button): add primary button variant
fix(navbar): correct mobile menu toggle
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

**Push to the Forked Repository**

```sh
git push -u origin feat/add-new-component
```

**Sync with Upstream Again**

- If the upstream `main` branch has been updated while working, integrate changes into your feature branch to avoid conflicts.

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Pull requests

We use Pull Requests (PRs) to review and merge changes. Follow these steps when creating a PR:

**Open a Pull Request to the main repository:**

- Target the main branch (or the branch specified by maintainers).
- Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes.
- Reference any related issues (e.g., Closes #12).
- **AI-Assisted Work Disclosure:** If you used AI tools to help generate or significantly modify code in your PR, please disclose this in the PR description. This helps maintainers conduct a more thorough review.

**Wait for review:**

- Maintain open communication with reviewers.
- Make any requested changes by committing in local feature branch
- After making changes, commit and push to the same branch—the PR will update automatically..

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: address review feedback"
git push
```

**A maintainer will merge your PR once it’s approved.**
