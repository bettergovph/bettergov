# BetterGov.ph

A community-led initiative to create a better and more usable Philippine national government website.

## Why We're Building This Project

The current state of Philippine government websites, particularly the main portal [www.gov.ph](https://www.gov.ph), presents numerous challenges for citizens:

- The main Gov.ph website is outdated and has not been updated for a long time
- Full of broken links and difficult navigation paths
- Inconsistent formatting and design across pages
- Poor user experience and accessibility issues
- Similar problems exist across most Philippine government agency websites

These issues create barriers for citizens trying to access essential government services and information.

## Our Mission

We are a volunteer-led initiative with a clear mission: to provide a 'better' and 'usable' website for the Philippines.

Our goals include:

- Building a proper national website that reflects Filipino values and culture
- Creating intuitive navigation and search functionality
- Ensuring accessibility for all citizens, including those with disabilities
- Providing accurate, up-to-date information about government services
- Establishing a model for how government digital services can and should work

## Features

- Modern, responsive design that works on all devices
- Comprehensive directory of government services and agencies
- User-friendly navigation and search
- Accessibility features for users with disabilities
- Regular updates and maintenance

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run E2E tests in headed browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Docker

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment and consistent environments.

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t bettergov .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:80 bettergov

# Run in detached mode
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name bettergov bettergov
```

**Access the application at:** `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Start the service
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the service
docker-compose down
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build with Node.js for building and nginx for serving the static files.

## Testing

### End-to-End Testing

This project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing to ensure critical user flows work correctly across different browsers and devices.

#### Running E2E Tests

- `npm run test:e2e` - Run all E2E tests headlessly
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Open Playwright UI to run and debug tests interactively
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run tests with visible browser windows
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` - Debug tests with Playwright Inspector
- `npm run test:e2e:codegen` - Record new tests using Playwright's code generator

#### E2E Test Coverage

Our E2E tests cover:

1. **Critical User Flows**
   - Homepage loading and navigation
   - PhilSys National ID registration
   - Government services search
   - Language switching
   - Emergency hotlines access

2. **Navigation**
   - Main menu navigation
   - Dropdown menus
   - Footer links
   - Breadcrumb navigation

3. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG compliance checks using axe-core
   - Keyboard navigation
   - ARIA labels and alt text
   - Focus indicators

4. **Performance**
   - Page load times
   - First Contentful Paint metrics
   - DOM size optimization
   - Image optimization
   - Slow network handling

#### Writing E2E Tests

E2E tests are located in the `e2e/` directory. Example test structure:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user can search for services', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByPlaceholder(/Search for services/i).fill('passport');
  await page.getByPlaceholder(/Search for services/i).press('Enter');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/search');
  await expect(page.locator('text=/passport/i')).toBeVisible();
});
```
